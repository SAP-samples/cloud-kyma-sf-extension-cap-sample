# SAP SucessFactors Extension Application - "Run Smooth"


## Description:
`Run Smooth` is a reference application which showcases how to build an event driven extensions for SAP SuccessFactors using the capabilities provided by [SAP Cloud Platform Extension Factory](https://help.sap.com/viewer/7b98ddc13f8d4a3ba08a74042a0baa7f/Cloud/en-US). This solution is developed by extending the Employee Central module of SAP SuccessFactors to build an event driven application.

This application showcases:
1. Capabilities of SAP Cloud Platform Extension Factory
2. Building application on SAP Cloud Platform using SAP Cloud Application Programming Model(CAP)
3. Building and Event driven extension application using SAP CP Enterprise Messaging
4. Consuming REST API's from SAP SuccessFactors using SAP CP Destination Service
5. SCI(IAS) Tenant integration with SF


## Business Scenario:

In this reference application called as Run Smooth a business scenario is used to showcase the technology components.
A Manager maintains in the Run Smooth application the staffing details of all the projects to which the employees reporting to him are contributing to.  He can create project and assign employees to the projects. An employee contributing to a project might decide to leave the team/ company. When this happens, the manager gets a notification with the projects that the employee is working on and the skillsets of the employee. This information can be used by manager to find/hire a replacement for employee and assign the projects.

#### Features:
* Create Projects
* Assign Employees
* View the list of projects, employees working on the projects.
* Get notification when an employee is leaving the team with the consolidated report on the skills of the employee.

## Architecture

### Solution Diagram

![solution diagram](./documentation/images/SolutionDiagram.PNG)

The Run Smooth application is developed using [SAP Cloud Application programming Model (CAP)](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/) and runs on the SAP Cloud Platform, Cloud Foundry Environment. It consumes platform services like Enterprise Messaging, SAP HANA and Destination. The events generated in SuccessFactors are inserted into the Enterprise messaging queue. The application running in Cloud Foundry polls the queue for these messages and inserts them into the HANA database. The run smooth application also makes calls to SF OData APIs to get SF data.

> Note: SAP fiori elements floorplans for OData V4 is in Lab preview and would be GA later this year.

## Requirements
* [Node js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* SuccessFactors test or demo instance.
>Note: Please do not try running this application against a SuccessFactors productive instance as it involves triggering a Termination Event from SuccessFactors.
* [Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli#downloads)
* To build the multi target application, we need the [Cloud MTA Build tool](https://sap.github.io/cloud-mta-build-tool/), download the tool from [here](https://sap.github.io/cloud-mta-build-tool/download/)
* For Windows system, install 'MAKE' from https://sap.github.io/cloud-mta-build-tool/makefile/
>Note: @sap Node.js packages have moved from https://npm.sap.com to the default registry https://registry.npmjs.org.
If sap-registry is set in your system please delete by using below command.   
   
    `npm config delete "@sap:registry"`
>Note: Minimum version to run the application is CDS : 4.x.x
* Install the following:
  1. cds    - `npm install -g @sap/cds` `npm install -g @sap/cds-dk`
  2. [multiapps plugin](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/multiapps-cli-plugin) - `cf install-plugin multiapps`  
  3. mbt         -  `npm install -g mbt`
